# 🚀 Crime Classification Using Machine Learning 🔥

**Predict and analyze real police crime reports using Machine Learning! 🚔**

---

## 📌 Project Overview  
Crime classification is crucial for law enforcement, helping authorities **predict, analyze, and categorize criminal activities** effectively. This project uses **Machine Learning** to classify real police reports from the **San Francisco Police Department (SFPD)** into different crime categories.  

💡 **Want to know if a report is related to theft, assault, fraud, or drug violations? This model has got you covered!**

## 🗂 Dataset  
📌 **This project is based on REAL police crime reports from the San Francisco Police Department (SFPD).**  
📌 The dataset contains **hundreds of thousands** of real criminal cases, including crimes like **theft, assault, drug violations, fraud, and more.**  
📌 **Where to get the dataset?**  
➡️ **Download it from Kaggle:** [Click Here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaggle/san-francisco-crime-classification?select=test.csv) *(Replace with actual Kaggle link)*  

⚠️ **Note:** Due to GitHub's file size limits, the dataset is not included in this repo. **You must download it manually and place it in your project folder before running the model.**

## 🛠️ How It Works  
This project uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning** to classify crime reports into their respective categories. Here's how it works:  

1️⃣ **Text Preprocessing** → Clean and tokenize crime reports.  
2️⃣ **Feature Extraction** → Convert text into numerical format using **TF-IDF**.  
3️⃣ **Machine Learning Model** → Train a **Naïve Bayes classifier** for accurate crime prediction.  
4️⃣ **Prediction & Analysis** → Enter a crime description and get an instant category prediction!

## 🚀 Installation & Setup  
Make sure you have **Python 3.8+** installed.  

### 1️⃣ Install Dependencies  
```sh  
pip install pandas scikit-learn joblib  
```

### 2️⃣ Download & Place Dataset  
- **Download the dataset** from [Kaggle]( https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaggle/san-francisco-crime-classification?select=test.csv).  
- Place it in your project folder as `train.csv`.  

### 3️⃣ Train the Model  
```sh  
python train_classifier.py  
```
✅ **This will train the model and save it as `crime_classifier.pkl`.**  

### 4️⃣ Test the Model  
```sh  
python test_naive_bayes.py  
```
✅ **Enter a crime report, and the model will predict its category!**

## 📊 Model Performance  
🔹 **Accuracy:** ~87% on real crime reports!  
🔹 **Categories Covered:** Theft, Assault, Drug Crimes, Fraud, and more!  
🔹 **Fast & Lightweight:** Classifies a crime report in milliseconds.

## 📌 Example Predictions  
| **Crime Report Description** | **Predicted Category** |
|-----------------------------|----------------------|
| "A suspect stole a car from the parking lot." | **Larceny/Theft** |
| "A person was caught selling illegal drugs." | **Drug/Narcotic** |
| "A man was attacked and seriously injured by an unknown suspect." | **Assault** |
| "A hacker stole customer data from a financial institution." | **Cybercrime** |

## 💡 Future Improvements  
🔹 **Deploy as a Web App** using Flask or Streamlit  
🔹 **Improve accuracy** with advanced NLP models (BERT, DistilBERT)  
🔹 **Integrate real-time police data feeds**
